- look for overloaded inherited methods, so not only in the current class but also in
all superclasses. If found, then single method in current class becomes already overloaded.
The dispatch method would replace final else clause with a call to its superclass (in order),
catching illegal argument exceptions until the final superclass has been called.
Order is depth first, left-to-right.

- The order of the dispatch method is not equal to the order of the declaration of the methods.

- Due to filtered methods, the comment of the resulting leftover method may not be the one of
the first declared method.

- List arguments which are empty will call the first found method, rather than generating 
an ambiguous call exception, if there were overloaded methods.
