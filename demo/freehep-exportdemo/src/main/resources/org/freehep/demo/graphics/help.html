<h1>FreeHEP Graphics Export Demo</h1>
<p>The FreeHEP Java library contains routines for outputting graphics in a 
variety of formats including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>PDF</li>
  <li>Postscript and Encapsulated postscript</li>
  <li>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</li>
  <li>Enhanced Meta-File (EMF)</li>
  <li>MacroMedia Flash (SWF)</li>
  <li>Bitmapped formats including GIF, PNG and JPG</li>
</ul>
<p>The emphasis is on producing high quality vector graphics for use with 
scientific visualization applications, but the library should be usable in many 
other fields.</p>
<p>This demo application provides a number of different test displays which can 
be saved to a variety of different formats using the <i>File</i>, <i>Export</i> 
menu item. Many of the graphics formats provide a variety of options, which can 
be accessed using the <i>Options... </i>button on the export dialog, after 
selecting an output format.</p>
<p>On Windows the EMF format can be used to directly paste vector graphics into 
other windows applications, such as PowerPoint and Word. Use the <i>Edit</i>, <i>
Copy</i> menu item to copy a page to the system clipboard, then paste it into 
your favorite application.</p>
