<P>A pure Java implementation of the stdhep event 
format.</P>
<P>Note, this package does not attempt to provide an OO abstraction for the 
event data. It is stored and retrieved in a fashion very analogous to the 
original stdhep common block (although without fixed size limitations).</P>
<P>This is a deliberate choice since:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>
  <DIV>It does not introduce a dependency between this package and any 
  particular event representation</DIV></LI>
  <LI>
  <DIV>It gives maximum performance.</DIV></LI></OL>
<P>The package has been designed to allow an OO event description to be 
superimposed on it. See the package hep.io.stdhep.adapter for an example of a 
mapping to/from the standard FreeHEP event representation.&nbsp;</P>

<P>See hep.io.stdhep.adapter</P>
