<P>An implementation of the Fermilab MCFIO package.</P>
<P>This package is used as the basis for reading and writing stdhep 
files.</P>
<P>The current Java implementation supports reading and writing MCFIO files. It 
is designed to be completely compatible with the C implementation. Files written 
using the C implementation should be readable using Java, and 
<EM>vice-versa</EM>. Currently the package only supports MCFIO version 1.0. Also 
supporting 2.x should be fairly straightforward.</P>

<P>@Status Stable.</P>
