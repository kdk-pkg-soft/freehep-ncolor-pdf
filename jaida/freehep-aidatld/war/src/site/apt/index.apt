Overview

        The AIDA tag library is an open source suite of custom tags that provide access to AIDA functionality from
JSP pages. It provides easy access to dynamically creating high quality physics and
astronomy plots, as well as providing access to histograms and ntuples stored in any AIDA store (which
includes ROOT files via rootd or xrootd).
