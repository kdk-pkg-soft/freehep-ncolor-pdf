Here is a small file to test the ConditionalInputStream.

It is all based on the statements:

-  @ifdef
-  @ifndef
-  @else
-  @endif

which can be escaped like \ @ifdef

So:

              
FREEHEP is defined
            
FREEHEP and WIRED are defined
     
                                   
      
     
                 
      

some other @cvs and @java signs

             
                     
      

moreover, empty lines and spaces should be output for every character removed.


This is line number 34.
