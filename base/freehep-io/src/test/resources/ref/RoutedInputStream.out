StartDThis is part of the main stream,[StartA:StartAbut this is part of the A stream.EndA]while this
is again part of the main stream.

Of course it could be more difficult:

SStStaStarStart[StartB:StartBis where stream B starts
and this can be several lines long
and ends when we see EndB]

and...

[StartC:StartC
Lets see if this ends up again in the main stream
EndC]StartE, because it should not...
EndE

and the next one should be

[EarlyClosed:SClose]

and this is the end.
EndD
