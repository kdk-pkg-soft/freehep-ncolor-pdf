Here is a small file to test the ConditionalInputStream.

It is all based on the statements:

- \@ifdef
- \@ifndef
- \@else
- \@endif

which can be escaped like \\@ifdef

So:

@ifdef FREEHEP
FREEHEP is defined
@ifdef WIRED
FREEHEP and WIRED are defined
@else
FREEHEP is defined but WIRED is NOT
@endif
@else
<nothing> defined
@endif

some other @cvs and @java signs

@ifndef WIRED
WIRED is NOT defined.
@endif

moreover, empty lines and spaces should be output for every character removed.


This is line number 34.
