- look for charge (gamma)
- mean life = stable (gamma)
- do something proper with normal fonts

- particlerefs in decaymodes
- yappi.cern.ch
- check numbers
- missing decaymodes
- masses, lt and w with ranges
- decay mode names not correct
- fix anti-particle names
- add confidence level, scale factor and p
- ccbar not found as ccbar but as cc in decay modes
- make sure we do not enter empty named decay modes

- Rare decay contains 0x0 character!
