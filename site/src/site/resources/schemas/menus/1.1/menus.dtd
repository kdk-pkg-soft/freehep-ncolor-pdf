The DTD of a menu system.

name		= a unique identifier of the component of the menu system
icon		= a String which holds the path of the icon image, e.g. "images/newJob.gif"
description	= a String which provides the tooltip text to show for the menu item, e.g. "Make a new job."
command		= a String which specifies the command that the menuItem invokes when chosen, e.g. "NewJob"
mnemonic	= the key that responds to the Alt (on Win32) key via the menu hierarchy to invoke the menu item

The accelerator	is the key that, in combination with modifiers in {CTRL, ALT, SHIFT, META}, allow
a meny item to be directly invoked.  Since the accelerator key is specified as one of the infamous
VK_ constants (used in Java and, I am told, Win32), all keys, even numbers and function keys
satisfy the production:
	Name ::= (Letter | '_' | ':') (NameChar)*
As such, I initially made the accelerator's key an ID in order to globally ensure uniqueness among
the accelerators that are specified.  However, this would prevent the same key from being used with
more than one modifier, which is ridiculous.  So it is up to the client programmer to enforce
the within-menu uniqueness constraint on mnemonics AND the global key + modifier uniqueness
constraint on accelerators.  This is unfortunate, but I know of no way to specify a composite ID
(an ID formed of multiple attributes) in XML.

By default (if only the key attribute is specified), an accelerator defaults to using the CTRL
modifier only.

It is possible to have a toolBarPanel at level 1 and build this directly, but this design was
scrapped since it was subsequently a bit messy to get handles to the toolbars if all that was
returned was a handle to the panel they were in and for the more fundamental reason that toolbars
are much less static than menus and as such should be "top level" style objects.
