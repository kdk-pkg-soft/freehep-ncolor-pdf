<h1>JAIDA</h1>
AIDA in Java

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>JAIDA is a Java implementation of the Abstract Interfaces for Data Analysis (<a href="http://aida.freehep.org/">AIDA</a>);
it is part of the <a href="../index.html">FreeHEP</a> library. 
JAIDA allows Java programmers to quickly and easily create histograms, 
scatter plots and tuples, perform fits, view plots and store and retrieve 
analysis objects from files. JAIDA can be used either in a non-graphical environment 
(for batch processing) or with a GUI to be used just to
display plots. In addition files written 
with JAIDA adhere to the AIDA IO standards and can be read by any AIDA compliant 
analysis system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>JAIDA is used internally by 
<a href="http://jas.freehep.org/jas3">JAS3</a> which provides a full featured 
GUI in addition to the above functionality.</p>
<p>By using the AIDA C++--&gt;Java adapter (<a href="../aidajni/index.html">AIDAJNI</a>), JAIDA can also be used 
from any C++ program.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The current release of JAIDA is 3.2.4, and is based on AIDA 3.2.1. We are still
providing support for JAIDA 3.0.x.</p>
<p>For details on how to use JAIDA give a look at the
<a href="v3.2.4/ReleaseNotes.html">release notes</a>.</p>
