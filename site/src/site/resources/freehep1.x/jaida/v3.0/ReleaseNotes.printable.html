<h1>JAIDA</h1>
AIDA in Java

<h1>JAIDA 3.0.1 Release Notes</h1>
<h3>What is Included in the Release</h3>
<p>This current release of JAIDA is designed to be used with
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html">Java 1.4.0 </a>or later. 
It will not work with earlier versions of Java. </p>
<p>Check the following <a href="MissingFeatures.html">list</a> to see which part 
of AIDA are not fully implemented.</p>
<p>Several JAR files are included in this release. You must include all of the 
required files in your CLASSPATH to be able to use AIDA. In addition there are 
several optional files.</p>
<h4>Required Files</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>aida.jar</b> - The specification of the AIDA interfaces</li>
  <li><b>aida-dev.jar </b>- The developer level specification of the AIDA 
  interfaces</li>
  <li><b>freehep-hep.jar</b> - The base (non-graphical) AIDA implementation</li>
  <li><b>freehep-base.jar</b> - Some utilities used by freehep-hep</li>
  <li><b>openide-lookup.jar</b> - Utility used by AIDA implementation</li>
  <li><b>jel.jar</b> - Utility used by AIDA implementation </li>
  <li><b>optimizers.jar</b> - Optimization package containing the optimizer
    UNCMIN </li>
</ul>
<h4>Optional Files</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>JASAIDA.jar</b> - Required if you need to display plots </li>
  <li><b>jas.jar</b> - Required if you need to display plots</li>
  <li>OS-dependent <b>minuitAdapter</b> library - Required to perform fits using Minuit. Configuration:
      <ul>
          <li>On <b>Windows</b> - add directory with minuitAdapter library file to the PATH</li>
          <li>On <b>Linux</b> or <b>Solaris</b> - add directory with minuitAdapter library file to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH</li>
          <li>On <b>Mac OSX</b> - add directory with minuitAdapter library file to the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</li>
      </ul> 
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Limitations/Features of the Current Release</h3>


<p><b>Histograms</b> - We have provided a full implementation of the AIDA 3.0 
histogram interfaces, including histogram arithmetic and projections and slices. 
Slicing of 3D histogram is not yet supported.</p>


<p><b>Profile</b> - One and two dimensional Profile histograms are fully implemented.
</p>


<p><b>Clouds</b> - We have provided a full implementation of the AIDA 3.0 
cloud interfaces. By default clouds will &quot;auto-convert&quot; to histograms when they 
reach 100,000 entries. You can turn off auto-conversion by specifying the option 
&quot;autoConvert=no&quot; when creating the Cloud.</p>

<p><b>DataPointSet</b> - A full implementation of the AIDA 3.0 is implemented including operations
among DataPointSets.</p>


<p><b>Trees and IO - </b>The following methods are not yet implemented, mv, cp, and symlink. The current implementation of&nbsp; ITree 
supports reading and writing AIDA standard XML files (.aida files) in either 
gzip compressed format, or uncompressed format. You can control this via the 
options parameter when the ITree is created. The default is &quot;compressed=yes&quot;.</p>
<p><b>Tuples - </b>Most of the functionality of AIDA ITuple interface is 
supported, including creating, filling and querying Tuples. The project methods 
are implemented, but currently the Evaluators are limited to single columns of 
the tuple, and filters are not yet supported at all. Full interactive analysis 
of Tuples stored in .aida files is supported by using the separate 
<a href="http://jas.freehep.org/documentation/tupleexplorer/">JAS Tuple 
Explorer</a>.</p>
<p><b>Plotting - </b>Full support for the IPlotter interface is included, 
including regions and overlays, except that the write() function is not yet 
implemented. In the Java implementation the Plotter observes all displayed 
Histograms and Clouds, and will automatically update the display as necessary. 
Therefore the IPlotter.refresh() method is currently ignored in the Java 
implementation. Not all AIDA implementations will do this, so you for 
portability you should still periodically call the refresh() method. Similarly 
the Java implementation is multi-threaded, so plots will be refreshed while the 
main program continues to run, and hence the IPlotter.interact() method is also 
ignored by the Java implementation. Currently only 1D and 2D histograms and 
clouds can be displayed (not 3D). Histograms with variable bin-widths are not 
yet displayed correctly.</p>

<p><b>Fitting </b>- The flexible design of the IFitter interface allows the user
to switch very easily the optimizer engine used in the minimization process and the
type of fit method used. We currently support two optimizers: <i>Minuit</i> and <a href
"http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov/otc/Guide/SoftwareGuide/Blurbs/uncmin.html"><i>Uncmin</i></a>.
The available fit methods are: <i>LeastSquares</i>, <i>Chi2</i>, <i>CleverChi2</i>,
<i>BinnedMaximumLikelihood</i> and <i>UnbinnedMaximumLikelihood</i>.</p>

<p><b>Functions</b>- Two types of functions can be created with the IFunctionFactory:
built-in functions and scripted functions. Currently the only built-in functions
we provide are the <i>Polynomial</i>, the <i>Exponential</i>, the one and two
dimensional <i>Gaussian</i> that can be created through the <i>createFunctionByName</i>
method of the <i>IFunctionFactory</i> using for the functions model <i>p</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>g</i>
and <i>g2</i> rispectively. No operations among them are currently supported. For more
complicated functions the user should create scripted functions throught the <i>createFunctionFromScript</i>
method.
