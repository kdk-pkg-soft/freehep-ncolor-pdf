<h1>WebPage</h1>
Web Page Generation System

<h1>Overview</h1>
The WebPage system generates consistent webs with for instance menus and banners.
It can run in both offline mode, where it generates all the pages for local use, or
as a servlet in a servlet engine, where pages are generated on the fly as they are requested.
The system can also generate printable pages, without menu on the side.
