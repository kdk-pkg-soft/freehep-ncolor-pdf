<h1>FreeHEP IO</h1>
Extensions to the Java IO system

        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>The FreeHEP IO package extends the Java IO package with a number of 
        input and output streams.</p>
        <p>The FreeHEP IO package lives in org.freehep.util.io and is included 
        in freehep-base.jar.</p>
        <p>The FreeHEP IO streams are in use by the FreeHEP
        <a href="http://java.freehep.org/vectorgraphics">VectorGraphics</a> 
        package and the PostScript viewer. Of course all these classes are 
        usable elsewhere.</p>
        <p>A special part of the streams are the &quot;Tagged&quot; in and output streams 
        which allow for tagged blocks to be read and written.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="ClassDiagram.png" width="720" height="540"></p>
        <p>Below follows a description of the different streams available:</p>
        <h2>General Streams</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt><b>FinishableOutputStream</b></dt>
          <dd>This interface allows you to call finish() on a stream, which will 
          write any end-of-stream marker.</dd>
          <dt><b>NoCloseInputStream</b></dt>
          <dd>This class (which is buffered by itself) allows you to call a 
          non-active close(). If you have a stream from which you suddenly need 
          to read in a different encoding (ASCII85, ...), wrap the stream in a 
          NoCloseInputStream, then wrap that one in the encoding, read until the 
          end-of-stream marker, then close that stream and keep reading from the 
          underlying stream.</dd>
          <dt><b>BitIn- / OutputStream</b></dt>
          <dd>Reads or writes in bit format of any length bit streams.</dd>
          <dt><b>ByteOrderInput- / OutputStream</b></dt>
          <dd>Reads or writes lo- of hi-endian byte streams.</dd>
          <dt><b>ByteCountInput- / OutputStream</b></dt>
          <dd>Reads or writes a stream while keeping track the number of bytes 
          read or written. Also keeps track of sub-counts if necessary.</dd>
          <dt><b>UniquePrintStream</b></dt>
          <dd>Keeps track of the strings one is printing and prints them only on 
          the first occasion. Allows you to filter error messages for instance.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2>Standard Encoding Streams</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt><b>ASCII85In- / OutputStream</b></dt>
          <dd>Reads or writes ASCII85 encoding, used in e-mail for instance.</dd>
          <dt><b>ASCIIHexIn- / OutputStream</b></dt>
          <dd>Reads or writes ASCIIHex encoding.</dd>
          <dt><b>DCTIn- / OutputStream</b></dt>
          <dd>Reads or writes Discrete Cosine Transform encoding, used in JPEG 
          image for instance.</dd>
          <dt><b>RunLengthIn- / OutputStream</b></dt>
          <dd>Reads or writes Run Length encoding, used in PostScript sometimes.</dd>
          <dt><b>EExecEn- / Decryption</b></dt>
          <dd>Reads or writes EExec encoding, used in Type1 fonts.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2>Tagged Streams</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt><b>TaggedInput- / OutputStream, Tag, UndefinedTag, TagSet, Action, 
          Action.Unknown </b>and<b> ActionSet</b></dt>
          <dd>Reads or writes tags. Tags are blocks identified by some tag-id 
          and a tag-length. A specific TagSet can be used to handle the tags as 
          they are read or written. UndefinedTags can be skipped automatically. 
          For writing the tag-length is automatically calculated. Total stream 
          length can also be calculated. Actions are handled as a special set of 
          &quot;Tags&quot;.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2>Conditional Streams</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt><b>ConditionalInputStream</b></dt>
          <dd>Reads a stream and filters parts depending on properties set and 
          statements in the stream. Works like the conditional compilation part 
          of a C pre-processor.</dd>
          <dt><b>RoutedInputStream</b> and <b>RouteListener</b></dt>
          <dd>Routes a stream to a listener, who can keep reading from the 
          stream, for a certain delimited part of the stream. </dd>
          <dt><b>PromptInputStream</b> and <b>PromptListener</b></dt>
          <dd>Reads a stream until the prompt and signals the listener.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2>Miscellaneous Classes</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt><b>StandardFileFilter</b></dt>
          <dd>Implements a filter with the default file filter scheme used in 
          most Operating Systems. You can specify &quot;*&quot; for 0 or more &quot;any&quot; 
          characters, and &quot;?&quot; for a single &quot;any&quot; character.</dd>
        </dl>
