<h1>AID - Abstract Interface Definition</h1>
Compiler for Language Independent Interfaces


<h1>Enhancement Requests</h1>
<ul>
<li>Provide a generator which generates an empty C++ code implementation of
all the aid interface definitions. This would also imply that one needs to
generate the implementation header files.</li>
<li>Handle mapping of constant string to C++ other than define, based on
some property file. (AIDA will need define, LCIO wants something different,
which works in gcc only).
</ul>
