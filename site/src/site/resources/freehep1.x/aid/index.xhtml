        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>AID is a tool to generate language specific interfaces and classes (Java,
        C++, ...)&nbsp; from abstract interface definition source files (.aid). </p>
        <P>
        The tools reads in one or more .aid files, parses them for correctness and keeps
        all information in a runtime-type-identification (RTTI) tree in memory. It then
        uses several generators to generate the language specific interfaces and/or
        classes. It also uses a simple pre-processor to handle cases where the method
        definitions differ between different languages.
        <p>The system is depicted below:</p>
