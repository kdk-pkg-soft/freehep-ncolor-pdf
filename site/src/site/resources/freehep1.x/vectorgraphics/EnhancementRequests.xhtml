  <h1>Enhancement Requests</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>Java Graphics allows for arbitrary (non-nested) usage of graphics contexts, while non of the output drivers
    does so. We could either fix this, by keeping state, by doing some kind of auto-dispose, or by at least signaling
    the error.</li>

    <li>Document Copy-and-Paste feature of EMF for Microsoft Office tools.</li>
  </ul>
