  <h1>XML Schema</h1>
  <p>The YaPPI XML data model is shown below. The base PPML element may contain
    Family and ParticleType elements, and so on. Elements may have attributes
    (required attributes are shown in bold). A ParticleType, in addition to
    its attributes, can contain arbitrary Data elements. Decays are stored
    in separate Decay elements, and may also be grouped in DecayGroups. Independently
    of particle properties, a heirarchy of Family elements (referring to particles
    by their name) defines the particle family tree. </p>

    TheXML data files</a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    The particle data in xml may be conveniently broken up into several files,
    according to what best fits how the data will be used. Following the link
    above will give you access to these data files: </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>PDG-Family.xml </li>
      <li>PDG-Properties.xml </li>
      <li>PDG-NormalDecayChannels.xml </li>
      <li>PDG-LimitDecayChannels.xml </li>
      <li>PDG-RareDecayChannels.xml </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Decay information has been broken up into three separate files, according
    to their fraction size, categorized as either <strong>normal</strong>,
    <strong>limit</strong> or <strong>rare</strong>. Normal decay information
    is what a physicist would most likely use most often. For applications
    that also need to include more decay precision, the limit and rare files
    may also be read as necessary. </p>
