  <h1>Contributors</h1>
  <p> YaPPI is part the <a href="http://java.freehep.org/">FreeHEP Java Library</a>,
    thus being looked after by the same authors, i.e. namely Mark D&ouml;nszelmann
    and Tony Johnson at SLAC. </p>
  <p>In Jan/Feb 2001, Mario Ruggier (CERN)
    did a general review of the project, improving documentation, web site,
    and ironing out a number of other inconsistencies. </p>
  <h2>Original Implementation - Summer 2000</h2>
    The implementation was created by Patrick Hellwig during summer 2000,
    while at CERN as a summer student, under the supervision of Mark D&ouml;nszelmann
    (now at SLAC) and Tony Johnson (SLAC), following a proposal of the idea by Paolo
    Palazzi (CERN).
