  <h1>User Requirements</h1>
  <p>To find out the goals of this project we define User
    Requirements. These are small, separated tasks which can be implemented
    step by step. Every user requirement is one feature of the upcoming software
    and implementation. It is very important, that it is possible to check
    afterwards, if a particular user requirement was accomplished or not.
    If not, it is easier to define the future work, which has to be done.</p>
  <p>We begin with the most general user requirement: A
    database has to be built up.</p>
  <p>Define a data model fitting to all data requirements.</p>
  <p>See the data model section.  </p>
  <p>Choose a database system which is accessible in
    many ways (also over the web) and run able on many platforms</p>
  <p>Fitting to the very wide usage of the database we took XML
    as format. We have the following reasons: A standard database system like
    Oracle or MySQL is system dependent and needs a high level administration
    team. The advantage of such a system would be very fast access and a high
    security level. Both we don&#146;t need really, because the data is most
    times just read only. The data changes not very often and could be just
    copied as a backup to a tape. There is no need of a high-tech database
    system.   </p>
  <p>A XML file can be published easy on the web without a special
    protocol or server. On the other hand a XML file can be also stored on
    a harddisk. You need no software for a XML file, but your XML interface.  </p>
  <p>XML is accessible in many standard database systems (for
    example Oracle) and in nearly every programming language (C++, Java, &#133;).  </p>
  <p>Create a human and computer readable database
    definition file.</p>
  <p>As database definition standard we use the &#147;XML Schema&#148;
    definition. Unfortunately until now it is only a working draft and not
    a recommendation.</p>
  <p>August 16, 2000: Actual version of XML-Schema: 7 April 2000  </p>
  <p>Create a test data file by hand</p>
  <p>Additional data must be easily addable</p>
  <p>If a user wants to add his own data he can add a XML file
    with his own data. The data inside will be added.   </p>
  <p>Data should be easily modifiable / overwrite able
  </p>
  <p>If a user doesn&#146;t want to use specific data or overwrite
    special values he can use a second XML file, where the specific data is
    provided.   </p>
  <p>Data should be imported from other databases.</p>
  <p>This database is not intended to be used as first order
    database. The intention is to provide the particle properties to a wide
    range of users, but the data itself should be taken out of a other database
    (Particle Data Group (PDG)). For this reason interfaces and import utilities
    must be written.   </p>
  <p>August 16, 2000: We have an import utility for the &#147;.mc&#148;
    file from the Particle Data Group Web Site
    (<a href="http://pdg.lbl.gov/">http://pdg.lbl.gov</a>).
    Problem here is the contents: This is only very few of data: ASCII-Name,
    PDG-ID-Number, Mass, Width and Charge.   </p>
  <p>August 16, 2000: We have a slight approach to get the whole
    PDG-database. If this happens we have to look, what actually is in the
    database and how we can get the useful information out of it. If we get
    no access to this database another idea would be to get the information
    out of the web-published Postscript files (*.PS) on the PDG web site.
    I have looked a bit on it and it seems to be possible to get it out.  </p>
  <p>August 24, 2000: We have a copy of the PDG database from
    1998, but the computed results are missing (table RESULTS_SUMMARY). I
    (Patrick Hellwig) have requested the FORTRAN programs to compute these
    values from the PDG. I hope they will arrive soon.  </p>
  <p>A data administration program should be written.
  </p>
  <p>The following idea: Build up an overall software: Add/Modify/Delete
    Particles, Add/Modify/Delete FamilyStructures, Add/Modify/Delete Sources,
    Add/Modify/Delete Comments, create new XML files (import or type in data),
    export data (create hardcode), search and browse data, display treelike
    structure, etc.  </p>
  <p>August 24, 2000: Until now it seems to me, that I will not
    have the time to do it until my departure.  </p>
  <p>A Java Servlet should be written to browse and
    search through the database</p>
  <p>August 16, 2000: The servlet can actually search for particle
    name and PDGID. But it can&#146;t display the decay modes until now.   </p>
  <p>August 24, 2000: The servlet is now able to display also
    the decay modes either in HTML-format or LaTeX format  </p>
  <p>The interface must be capable to read multiple
    data files</p>
  <p>August 16, 2000: This must be also implemented.  </p>
  <p>August 24, 2000: Implementation has been done.  </p>
  <p>Provide an web site with all the information</p>
  <p>You are currently looking on it.   </p>
  <p>August 24, 2000: I have no specific server until now.  </p>
  <p>The database must provide the same information
    like all the other old software databases</p>
  <p>It must be possible to implement new Particle
    Properties without recompiling code or changing the database structure</p>
  <p>This is done by the data structure. You have an entry like:
    &lt;data name=&#148;Mass&#148; value=&#148;1.233&#148;/&gt; to store the
    data. So if additional data will come up it is easy to add another &lt;data
    &#133;/&gt; element.  </p>
  <p>For each data entry there should be the possibility
    for a source entry</p>
  <p>August 16, 2000: I have thought about this, but it is not
    implemented yet.  </p>
  <p>August 24, 2000: The XML Schema file (XSD) is prepared for
    this, but the Parser doesn&#146;t care about it. Until now I haven&#146;t
    implemented the Interface for &#147;source&#148; entries.  </p>
  <p>For each particle the following data must be stored:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Family (Bosons, Mesons, etc.)</li>
      <li>Name in ASCII encoding </li>
      <li>Name in typsetting format (LaTeX)</li>
      <li>Standard Particle ID</li>
      <li>Charge </li>
      <li>Width (+Error, -Error)</li>
      <li>Mass (+Error, -Error)</li>
      <li>has antiparticle (yes / no)</li>
      <li>2J (Quantum Information)</li>
      <li>&lt;add more general data&gt;</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
