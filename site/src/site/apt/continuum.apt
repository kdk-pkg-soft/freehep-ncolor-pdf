FreeHEP Continuous Integration
    
	We run Continuum on all our FreeHEP and WIRED projects. 
	Continuum checks every hour for changes in the HEAD 
	revision of subversion. All projects should in principle compile and test.
	
	See {{{http://glast-heprep01.slac.stanford.edu:8080/continuum/servlet/continuum}FreeHEP Continuum}} 
	(only reachable from the SLAC Network for now).
