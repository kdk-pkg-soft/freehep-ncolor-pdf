JAS3 and JAIDA
    
    JAIDA is intended for use in simple standalone Java applications. It provides the full {{{http://aida.freehep.org/}AIDA}} 
functionality for Java, but only limited "GUI" functionality. 
{{{http://jas.freehep.org/jas3}JAS3}} builds on the functionality of JAIDA and 
adds many GUI based interactive analysis tools. JAS3 is available from 
{{{http://jas.freehep.org/jas3}http://jas.freehep.org/jas3}}.

    In {{{http://jas.freehep.org/jas3}JAS3}} it is possible to execute any {{{http://aida.freehep.org/}AIDA}} 
program written in either Java, Jython or Pnuts.
